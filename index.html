      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, I’m <strong>Zyph (or Zyhpor)</strong> — a content creator and software engineer with a focus on 
        <span class="highlight">backend development</span> and <span class="highlight">team leadership</span>. 
        While I enjoy building systems and writing code, my real strength lies in managing teams, guiding projects, 
        and helping ideas grow into something impactful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I mainly create gaming content, especially around <span class="highlight">Call of Duty</span>, though I explore 
        many other games as well. Alongside content creation, I dedicate time to software projects where I can contribute 
        both technically and strategically.
      </p>
      <p>
        I’m currently open to opportunities where I can <span class="highlight">support and manage projects</span>, 
        with a focus on helping them achieve long-term success. I’m not motivated by payment unless it’s tied to 
        a significant opportunity, such as collaborating with a <span class="highlight">triple-A game studio</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need a reliable <span class="highlight">project lead, problem solver, or second opinion</span> on tough decisions, 
        I’d be glad to help. Feel free to reach out through Discord or by email at 
        <a href="mailto:devbobbynetworks@gmail.com">devbobbynetworks@gmail.com</a>.
